You are looking for a place where you don't feel limited, where you can come up with weird ideas and get the approval to test them out. You like to dress professionally, but are proud of your mohawk too! What does a Sign Graphics Designer/Production position do?We are known for two things around here. First is our never-ending desire to make our customers happy. Second is our award-winning, business-altering, cityscape-changing sign project. The graphic designer is one of the most important parts of our success! . We need talented graphic designers to keep our workload ahead of schedule and ensure top-of-the-line quality sign projects for our customers. You are the creative part of our equation.
